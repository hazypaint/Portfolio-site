# Portfolio-site
P1 Portofolio site by a mock-up

This is project 1 from the Udacity FEND program.

I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developd a responsive website that  displays images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.
